# TSP and VRP Genetic Algorithms

This project implements Genetic Algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). These algorithms use evolutionary techniques to find optimized solutions for these classic combinatorial optimization problems.

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bianca-ghx/tsp-vrp-genetic-algorithms.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd tsp-vrp-genetic-algorithms
    ```
3. Install the required Python libraries

## Usage
To use the TSP and VRP genetic algorithms, follow these instructions:

1. Open the appropriate Jupyter Notebook for the problem you want to solve:
    - For TSP: `tsp.ipynb`
    - For VRP: `vrp.ipynb`
2. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the algorithm and see the results.
